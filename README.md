[SIGIR 2023] _SerenLens_: A large ground truth dataset on serendipity-oriented recommendation. [[paper]]()

## Introduction

_SerenLens_ is our collected large ground truth dataset on peopleâ€™s serendipity experiences. The dataset uses Amazon Reviews Data (McAuley et al. 2015) as base and collects the ground truth data on serendipity by our proposed _User Semantic Mining_ approach in [paper](). Currently, the dataset contains annotated review data of two domains: **Books** and **Movies & TV**. The **Books** data have 265,037 reviews, 2,346 users, and 113,876 items. The **Movies & TV** data have 74,967 reviews, 619 users, and 23,950 movies/TV.

 ## Data Statistics
 Data statistics of each domain in _SerenLens_ dataset, more details can be found in our [paper]():
 
 |Attribute|Books|Movies & TV|
 |:----|:----:|:----:|
 |**User invloved in the reviews of serendipity**|**2,346**|**619**|
 |Items involved in the reviews of serendipity|2,227|634|
 |Other reviews involved for the involved users|262,691|74,253|
 |**Total reviews involved**|**265,037**|**74,967**|
 |**Total items involved**|**113,876**|**23,950**|

 ## Data Format
Datasets of each domain share a uniform format:
 
 * user_id: the id number of users.
 * item_id: the id number of items.
 * timestamp: the timestamp of the review.
 * review: the content of the reviews.
 * rating: the 5-star rating of the reviews.
 * label: the label of serendipitous feelings for the reviews, 0 denotes not serendipitous feeling, 1 denotes serendipitous feeling.
